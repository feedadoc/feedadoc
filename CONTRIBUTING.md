## Issue Tracking
We do our best to keep issues up-to-date. There are some simple things you can do to help us.

## Development guidelines
The goal of this project is to get a good product off the ground quickly as things are rapidly changing. As such, following these guidelines will really help.
- Consider other developers when adding tools/changes. If the change requires some obscure tooling or changes the default way of doing things, be sure to provide thorough documentation.
